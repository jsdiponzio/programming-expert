Project Criteria:
- Create a program that can schedule games that teams will play for the first round of an end of year tournament.
- First ask the user to input the number of teams; assume there will always be an even number of teams. Then ask for the names of all of the teams.
- Determine the number of games that were played by each team; assume each team plays the same number of games.
- Determine the number of wins each team had during the regular season.
- In the first round of the tournament the teams with the most regular season wins play the teams with the least regular season wins.
- Output the games that should be played. The first game outputted should contain the team with the most regular season wins, the second game should contain the team with the second most regular season wins, etc.
- The home team of each game should be the team with the least wins of the two, if there is a tie in wins your program can chose any appropriate team.
